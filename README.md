Description
--
This container will create a yum repository from an RPMS directory and upload the contents to an Amazon S3 bucket. Set up your bucket as a static website and you have a yum repository that you can access from anywhere.

Usage
--
The container expects RPMS to live at:

    /home/makerpm/exports/RPMS
    
It also expects some environment variables:
* `ACCESS_KEY` -- an Amazon IAM credential
* `SECRET_KEY` -- an Amazon IAM credential
* `BUCKET_NAME` -- the name of your Amazon S3 bucket

For example:

    docker run --rm=true -ti --volumes-from=${BUILD_CONTAINER} \
      -e BUCKET_NAME=${YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME_HERE}               \
      -e ACCESS_KEY=$(cat .access_key)                         \
      -e SECRET_KEY=$(cat .secret_key)                         \
      jdef/s3repo

In this case the RPMS generated by my `${BUILD_CONTAINER}` would be uploaded as a yum repository to my `${YOUR_BUCKET_NAME_HERE}` S3 bucket. A yum `.repo` file to access the S3/Yum bucket might look like this:

    [my-s3-repo]
    name=My S3/yum repo - $basearch
    baseurl=http://___YOUR_BUCKET_NAME_HERE___.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/$basearch
    gpgcheck=0
